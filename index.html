                      By using ServerStatusPage, you represent and warrant that you meet all the requirements listed above, and that you won't use ServerStatusPage in a way that violates any laws or regulations. We may refuse service, close accounts of any users, remove posted content, and change eligibility requirements at any time.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Term</h3>
                    <p>
                      The term begins when you sign up and continues as long as you use the Service. Clicking the button means that you've officially "signed" the Terms. If you sign up on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Closing your account</h3>
                    <p>
                    This agreement may be terminated at any time for any reason, by you or ServerStatusPage, by giving notice to the other party. We may suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If we terminate your account without cause, we'll refund a prorated portion of any prepayment. We won't refund or reimburse you if there's cause, like a violation of these Terms. Once terminated, we may permanently delete your account and all the data associated with it, including your server listings. If you don't log in to your account for 12 or more months, we may treat your account as "inactive" and permanently delete the account and all the data associated with it.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Changes</h3>
                    <p>
                    We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms of Service on our Website and/or by sending an email to the last email address you gave us. Unless you terminate your account within 10 days, the new Terms will be effective immediately and apply to any continued or new use of the Service. We may change the Website, the Service, or any features of the Service at any time.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Account and password</h3>
                    <p>
                    You're responsible for keeping your account name and password confidential. You're also responsible for any account that you have access to, whether or not you authorised the use. You'll immediately notify us of any unauthorised use of your accounts. We're not responsible for any losses due to stolen or hacked passwords. We don't have access to your current password, and for security reasons, we may only reset your password.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Account disputes</h3>
                    <p>
                      We don't know the inner workings of your organisation or the nature of your personal relationships, and we don't arbitrate disputes over who owns an account. You won't request access to or information about an account that's not yours, and you'll resolve any account-related disputes directly with the other party. We decide who owns an account based on the content of the emails in that account, and if multiple people or entities are identified in the content, then we'll rely on the contact information listed for that account.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Payment</h2>
                <div class="tos-indent">
                  <h3>Premium listings</h3>
                    <p>
                      Our charges for premium listings are posted on our Website and may be changed form time to time. Payments for a listing to be upgraded for a period of time are due on the first day of the upgrade. To keep your listing upgraded after this period, you must pay for an additional period at the latest price, which may have changed since your last payment.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Missed payments and chargebacks</h3>
                    <p>
                      If you do not pay for a service on the first day the service is provided, or you reverse or chargeback a payment then we may terminate the service being provided without notice and reserve the right to refuse services to you in future. You will be liable for any losses incurred to yourself or ServerStatusPage, including but not limited to transaction fees, vendor fees, internal administration costs and the prorated price of the service we were providing.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Refunds</h3>
                    <p>
                      We'll give you a prorated refund if we have to terminate your account or remove your listings, provided that you have not violated any of these Terms. You won't be entitled to a refund from us under any other circumstances.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Changes</h3>
                    <p>
                    We may change our fees at any time by posting a new pricing structure to our Website and/or sending you a notification by email.

                  <h3>Compliance with laws</h3>
                    <p>
                    You represent and warrant that your use of the Service will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You're responsible for determining whether our Services are suitable for you to use in light of any regulations like HIPAA, GLB, EU Data Privacy Laws, or other laws.

                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Liability</h2>
                <div class="tos-indent">
                  <h3>Limitation of liability</h3>
                    <p>
                    To the maximum extent permitted by law, you assume full responsibility for any loss that results from your use of the Website and the Services, including any downloads from the Website. We and our Team won't be liable for any indirect, punitive, special, or consequential damages under any circumstances, even if they're based on negligence or we've been advised of the possibility of those damages. Our total liability for all claims made about the Service in any month will be no more than what you paid us for the Service the month before.
                    </p>
                  <h3>No warranties</h3>
                    <p>
                    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we provide the material on the Website and the Service as is. That means we don't provide warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Indemnity</h3>
                    <p>
                    You agree to indemnify and hold us and our Team harmless from any losses (including attorney fees) that result from any claims you make that aren't allowed under these Terms due to a "Limitation of Liability" or other provision. You also agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any losses (including attorney fees) that result from third-party claims that you or someone using your password did something that, if true, would violate any of these Terms.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Attorney fees</h3>
                    <p>
                    If we file an action against you claiming you breached these Terms and we prevail, we're entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and any damages or other relief we may be awarded.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Equitable relief</h3>
                    <p>
                    If you violate these Terms then we may seek injunctive relief (meaning we may request a court order to stop you) or other equitable relief.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Subpoena Fees</h3>
                    <p>
                    If we have to provide information in response to a subpoena related to your account, then we may charge you for our costs. These fees may include attorney and employee time spent retrieving the records, preparing documents, and participating in a deposition.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
                    <p>
                    We and our Team aren't responsible for the behavior of any advertisers, linked websites, or other Members.

                  <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
                    <p>We won't be held liable for any delays or failure in performance of any part of the Service, from any cause beyond our control. This includes, but is not limited to, acts of God, changes to law or regulations, embargoes, war, terrorist acts, riots, fires, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, zombie apocalypse, floods, strikes, power blackouts, volcanic action, unusually severe weather conditions, and acts of hackers or third-party internet service providers.</p>
                  <h3>Survivability</h3>

                    </p>
                  <h3>Severability</h3>
                    <p>If it turns out that a section of this Agreement isn’t enforceable, then that section will be removed or edited as little as necessary, and the rest of the Terms will still be valid.</p>
                  <h3>Amendments and Waiver</h3>
                    <p>Amendments or changes to these Terms won’t be effective until we post revised Terms on the Website. If we don’t immediately take action on a violation of these Terms, we’re not giving up any rights under the Terms, and we may still take action at some point.</p>
                  <h3>Further Actions</h3>
                    <p>You’ll provide all documents and take any actions necessary to meet your obligations under these Terms.</p>
                  <h3>Notification of Security Breach</h3>
                    <p>
                    In the event of a security breach that may affect you, we’ll notify you of the breach and provide a description of what happened. If we determine, and notify you, that you need to inform anyone else, you’ll promptly do it.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
                    <p>
